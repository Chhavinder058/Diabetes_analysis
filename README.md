# ðŸ“Š Diabetes Analysis: Predicting Readmissions

A complete end-to-end analysis and prediction of hospital readmission in diabetic patients using machine learning.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project leverages a real-world dataset of over 100,000 diabetic patient records to:

- Explore trends and patterns that contribute to hospital readmission
- Apply logistic regression and random forest models to predict outcomes
- Visualize key insights to inform healthcare decision-making

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- Most readmitted patients are above 60 years old
- Patients with more diagnoses, inpatient stays, and medications have a higher risk
- Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression, but recall can still improve

---

## ðŸ¤– Models Used

| Model              | Accuracy | ROC AUC |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 62%      | 0.57    |
| Random Forest       | 58%      | 0.58    |

âœ… Evaluation includes confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importances.
